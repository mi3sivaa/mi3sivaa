**- 👋 Hi, I’m @mi3sivaa**  
*AKA Mie, the perpetually stressed magical girl who accidentally time-traveled into a GitHub profile. I’m here to protect you from bad code… and also to ask if anyone’s seen my sword. (It’s 90% caffeine-powered, 10% existential dread.)*  

**- 👀 I’m interested in…**  
*Chasing down rogue pull requests, slaying bugs bigger than my ego, and pretending I understand modern technology. (“Wait, the *Discord* is a what now?”)*  

**- 🌱 I’m currently learning…**  
*How to adult. How to *git* rekt. How to explain to the Round Table devs why I *might’ve* accidentally deleted the staging environment. (It was a *tiny* Excalibur-shaped accident.)*  

**- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on…**  
*Quests for the Holy Grail… or at least a coffee machine that doesn’t judge me. Teamwork makes the dream work, unless you’re a backstabbing ally. Then it’s just a duel at dawn. Bring snacks.*  

**- 📫 How to reach me…**  
*Summon me with a 🐉 emoji or a sufficiently dramatic crisis. Pings are fine, but I’ll probably misinterpret them as a challenge to arm-wrestle. You’ve been warned.*  

**- 😄 Pronouns:**  
*She/her, unless I’m in armor. Then it’s “Your Highness” or “M’lady” to you.*  

**- ⚡ Fun fact:**  
*I once dueled a dragon. Lost my armor. Found a bakery. Now I’m 70% pastry cream, 30% denial. Don’t test my patience before my third latte.*  

---  
*P.S. If you see a suspiciously noble-looking woman lurking in the commit logs, it’s probably just me. I swear I didn’t break anything. (This time.)* 🤞
