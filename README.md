- 👋 Hi, I’m @[YourUsername]
AKA [Your Nickname, if you have one], a Heroic Spirit of the Coder-class, mistakenly pulled from the Throne of Heroes into this… GitHub thing. My legend? I once fixed a bug on a Friday afternoon. My greatest shame? The time I accidentally committed directly to main.
- 👀 I’m interested in…
Battling the monstrous Bugs that plague the digital world. Forging mighty Artifacts (read: elegant functions). And deciphering the ancient runes of legacy code without losing my sanity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning…
The lost art of optimal mana distribution (read: efficient resource management). How to properly wield a Debugger-Chainsaw. And the true meaning of "Git Rebase" without invoking a timeline paradox.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on…
Quests to achieve the Holy Grail of perfect software. Seeking fellow Servants (any class, though Caster for debugging and Saber for brute-force refactoring are preferred) to join my Chaldea (read: dev team).*
- 📫 How to reach me…
Fling a Noble Phantasm (read: email) my way, or challenge me to a Duel (read: pair programming session). Just don't ask me to choose between JavaScript and Python – that's a class advantage I haven't figured out yet.
- 😄 Pronouns:
She/her, unless I've just written a particularly clean block of code, then it's "The Legendary One."
- ⚡ Fun fact:
My personal skill is "Accidental rm -rf," which I've somehow mastered over the years. My NP is "Excali-Bug," which usually just makes things worse, but with style.
Which epic tale of coding prowess (or lack thereof) best captures your spirit?
